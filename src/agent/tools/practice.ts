/**
 * THE PRACTICE TOOLS (practice sessions, owner design 2026-10-04): the
 * practice agent's ENTIRE toolset — `problem` (pose: terminates the turn;
 * the commitment rides the call's arguments, hidden from the learner UI)
 * and `conclude` (end the problem: normal result, the turn continues so
 * the same reply can reveal + pose the next). The gating law (owner
 * ruling): an agent cannot pose while a problem is active and cannot
 * conclude with nothing active — activeProblemOf is the single fold both
 * gates read.
 *
 * Mechanics-only descriptions (the doctrine ruling, 2026-10-04): the tool
 * descriptions carry WHAT to pass and WHAT happens — the theory, the
 * commit-before-pose law, the hint ladder all live in the system prompt
 * (prompts/practice/10-doctrine.md).
